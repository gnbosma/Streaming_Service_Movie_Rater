```{r}
# read in dataset

# Save locally and only include complete cases
data_orig <- readr::read_tsv(here::here("data-raw/actors.tsv.gz"), )
data <- data_orig[complete.cases(data_orig), ]

# split "KnownForTitles" and PrimaryProession columns so we have 1 item per cell 
data <- data %>% separate(knownForTitles, c("T1","T2", "T3", "T4"))
data <- data %>% separate(primaryProfession, c("P1","P2", "P3"))

# Actors 
```{r}

# Producers

# By Title 
```{r}
