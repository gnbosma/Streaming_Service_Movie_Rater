# Streaming_Service_Movie_Rater

This project explores the relationships between the popular rating of a movie, streaming service, and actors involved. Data was obtained from Kaggle (movies, streaming sites) and IMBd (ratings, actors) and merged using RMarkdown. This project also contains an R shiny application that displays popularity of included movies separated by streaming service. To read about our objectives, methods, and conclusions, see the file StreamingServiceMovieRater.Rmd.
